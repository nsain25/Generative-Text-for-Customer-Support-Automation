# Generative-Text-for-Customer-Support-Automation
Project Overview: Develop an AI-powered system to automate customer support interactions using generative models like GPT-3.5.

Use Cases:
Automated Response Generation:
Problem Statement: Customer support teams are overwhelmed by repetitive inquiries that could be handled by automated systems.
Solution: Implement a generative AI model to automatically generate accurate and context-aware responses to common customer queries, reducing the load on human agents and improving response times.

Personalized Customer Engagement:
Problem Statement: Customers expect personalized interactions that cater to their specific needs and preferences.
Solution: Use generative AI to create personalized engagement messages based on customer data and interaction history, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

For this project, we have made our own datasets, with 2 types of files, once contains the sample customer support data and the other has the sample customer support data after cleaning and preprocessing the data

Future scope, implementing this model using API Integration (i.e using OpenAI's API) and Automation, along with getting access to the API key
